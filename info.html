Despite her many attributes, what makes Maia famous is her music. Since her start, mxmtoon has released two studio albums, one compilation album, seven EPs, 25 singles as lead, and been featured in six as a featured artist.
        <h3>Early Life</h3>

        Maia was born July 9, 2000 in Oakland, California to a Chinese-American and a German-Scottish father. She has one older brother. Maia showed a strong inclination towards music from a young age, beginning violin lessons in 1st grade, followed by trumpet and classical cello. She expected to audition as a a cello for her school's 5th grade rock band, but was instead asked to sing. She became the band's vocalist. In 6th grade, she added guitar to her repretoire of instruments, with guidance from her father. She first used the alias "mxmtoon" on Instagram, where she posted comics. </p>
      <h3>Career</h3>
      <p>
        Maia began releasing covers and original music recorded in her bedroom on YouTube in 2013 under alias "mxmtoon," derived from her initials, and various singles throughout 2016 and 2017. She used GarageBand, as well as various found objects for percussion. In 2017, she collaborated with Peachy! on "Falling for U" which became an early signature song, amassing more than 300 million plays on Spotify.  Her first studio album, the masquerade, was truly shown up by its first leading single, "prom dress" which is by far mxmtoon's most popular release to date. The album is made all the more impressive considering it was a true indie release, no label. Her second studio album, the rising, was released in 2022, and is also a tremendous success, espcially leading single "mona lisa."
