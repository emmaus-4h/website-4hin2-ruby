      <h3>2017–2018: Plum Blossom</h3>
      <p>Maia began self-releasing songs on YouTube under the online alias "mxmtoon" in 2017; the name is derived from her initials. Although she started her career secretly, subsequent growth of her online presence compelled her to disclose her activity in this field to her family. Her early oeuvre was recorded with GarageBand in her parents' guest bedroom, and percussion tracks were created with found objects such as hair straighteners. After initially attempting to write comedy songs, she began writing in a confessional style.

      <p>Her 2017 collaboration with lo-fi producer Peachy, "Falling for U," became an early signature song; it has since garnered more than three hundred million streams on Spotify. In 2018, Maia released her debut EP, Plum Blossom; It was accompanied by the "Plum Blossom Tour," scheduled for the March of the following year. While it was initially scheduled for five US shows with fellow Californian singer-songwriter Khai Dreams in March 2019, it sold out and was extended to include additional concerts in North America and Europe, including opening appearances for bedroom pop YouTuber Cavetown.

The album's release had been accompanied by 21 Days, a podcast in audio diary format by Spotify that concerned Maia's activities while working on the project in New York City. To support the album, Maia embarked on The Masquerade Tour, of North America and United Kingdom, in the same month of the album's release. Her first graphic novel, The Adventures Of mxmtoon: The Masquerade, began selling in October 2019. In the succeeding month, Maia signed to the label of Kobalt Music Group, under a global publishing deal. She released a remix album, The Masquerade (The Edits) soon after, and recorded "Prom Dress" in Simlish, the fictional language used in The Sims games.

      <p>Maia released her first single of 2020, "Fever Dream," in January. "Fever Dream" was followed by EP Dawn in April; accompanying EP Dusk was released in October. In an interview given in the interregnum between the releases of the two EPs, Maia detailed an intention to make music that "gracefully said thank you and goodbye" to her past work. Dawn and Dusk were soon amalgamated to form album Dawn & Dusk; in the meantime, she also started a daily history podcast, 365 days with mxmtoon.

      <p>Maia was featured in Dork's Hype List of 2020, alongside artists including Girl in Red, Beabadoobee and Maisie Peters.

      <p>— mxmtoon 
      <p>Maia has been credited in NPR criticism as having an "endearingly intimate presence."[52] Her music has been described as "warm folk-pop tunes with acoustic ornamentations," "one part acoustic-pop a-la Kina Grannis, mixed with sharp lyricism and avant-garde, off-kilter melodics akin to Fiona Apple or PJ Harvey," and artistry that "explore[s] themes such as the trials of love, being a burden to those close to you, and connecting with your family's heritage." Joshua Bote of Paste wrote that Maia "might be the songwriter a new generation needs", noting that she is "made for these times" and is "armed with a ukulele, a sardonic charm and social media savvy;" he went on to describe her as "really, really good at the internet."

      <p>Grant Rindner of Nylon wrote: "With a commitment to covering topics she rarely hears addressed by other artists, and a keen understanding of how to bond with her audience, she's emerged as a charming and relatable singer-songwriter with a massive platform." After attending Maia's performance at the Gramercy Theatre, Briana Younger of The New Yorker wrote, "She sang of routine high-school problems, such as crippling self-doubt and unrequited love, with an emotional sophistication that reminded us that there are some things we never outgrow." Joe Coscarelli of New York Times compared Maia's bedroom pop style to that of Girl in Red, Clairo and Beabadoobee, as well as the folk-pop "simplicity" of Regina Spektor and The Moldy Peaches; he described her as a character "who overflows with earnestness and giggles", and her rise in popularity as the assemblage of "an independent, D.I.Y. mini-empire almost by accident."

      <p>Maia remains active on TikTok, where she has amassed nearly three million followers and 140 million likes, as of January 2023. To date, she has had online presences on Vine, Tumblr, Facebook, Twitch, Snapchat, Bandcamp, Pinterest, and SoundCloud, as well as TikTok. She also streams on Twitch, where she has over two hundred thousand followers.
      <h3>Influences</h3>
      <p>Maia has cited Arctic Monkeys, The Black Keys, Sufjan Stevens and Elliott Smith, and Clairo as major influences to her music.

      <h3 id=personal>Personal Life</h3>
      <p>Maia is a bisexual woman from a family of immigrants and currently lives in Brooklyn, New York, where she writes, records, and produces her own music from her home that she shares with her younger brother.
